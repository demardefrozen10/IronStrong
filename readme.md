This project was made using Python's web framework Flask and CSS framework Bootstrap, along with Vanilla HTML/CSS.
Exercises were gathered using API Ninja's Exercise API and images were web scraped using Beautiful Soup.

## How To Install Flask
Run the following command in Command Prompt:
<br>
$ pip install Flask

## How To Run The Web Application

To run the application, use the flask command or python -m flask. You need to tell the Flask where your application is with the --app option.

This launches a very simple builtin server, which is good enough for testing but probably not what you want to use in production. For deployment options see Deploying to Production.

Now head over to http://127.0.0.1:5000/, and you should see IronStrong web application.
